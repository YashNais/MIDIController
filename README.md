# MIDIController
MIDI Controller using Arduino IDE, HairlessMIDI and loopMIDI

This project is an Arduino-based MIDI controller using an ATmega328 microcontroller. It sends MIDI messages via 8 buttons and 2 potentiometers for note-on, note-off, and control-change events.

#Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: ATmega328 (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Buttons: 8 push buttons
Potentiometers: 2 analog pots
MIDI Interface: USB (via MIDI library)

#Features
8 Buttons: Send MIDI note-on/note-off messages.
2 Potentiometers: Send CC messages, mapped to 0-127.
Debouncing: Prevents multiple triggers from a single press.
MIDI Communication: Uses the MIDI Library.

#Setup
Install MIDI Library via Arduino IDEâ€™s Library Manager.
Wire Buttons to pins 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4.
Wire Pots to A0, A1.
Upload the Code to the Arduino and use a MIDI tool or DAW to test.

#Configuration
note: Starting note number (default: 48).
cc: Starting Control Change number (default: 1).
varThreshold: Minimum pot movement to send CC.

#License
Open-source. Modify freely.
